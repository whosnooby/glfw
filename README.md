# GLFW

## Introduction

GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan
application development.  It provides a simple, platform-independent API for
creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.

GLFW is licensed under the [zlib/libpng
license](https://www.glfw.org/license.html).

GLFW exists because of the contributions of [many people](CONTRIBUTORS.md)
around the world, whether by reporting bugs, providing community support, adding
features, reviewing or testing code, debugging, proofreading docs, suggesting
features or fixing bugs.

## About this fork
The [whosnooby/glfw](https://github.com/whosnooby/glfw) fork is a stripped down version of GLFW without any examples, tests, or documentation. It uses the [premake build system](https://premake.github.io) instead of CMake.
